Welcome to the [Impractical Labs](https://impractical.co) engineering blog! Here’s where we’ll share all our bad ideas so you can also do silly things.

We’re not exactly role models, so I’m not quite sure why you would _want_ to know what we’re doing, but it’s fun to share anyways.

As you can probably tell, this is still being set up. Please excuse the ~~mess~~ utter brokenness.
